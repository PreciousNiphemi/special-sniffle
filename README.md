## How To Run The Code

[] Input the csv of choice (Let the csv follow the current websites_sample.csv pattern). You can copy the websites_sample.csv file on your personal pc to see the format... Take specific note of where the row the column headers started from (row 2)

[] Let the csv inputed to be the script be named as "websites.csv". When inputing new websites.csv into the script after you've ran the script for a previous csv, feel free to rename the result csv from "websites.csv" to something like "websites_result_1.csv" so as to avoid conflicts of csv files.

[] Run "npm install" to install the dependencies.

[] Run "node scrape.js" to run the app
