						The technicians were friendly and honored my asking them to wear booties on my carpets. They spent 5 hours working constantly. Along with cleaning the ducts, the fireplace was cleaned and checked for functionality. Easy to clean inside but they were on the exterior of the fireplace accessed from my two story home. I cannot speak highly enough about the professionalism and follow up by this company. I will recommend Absolute to my friends and family. See you all next year!

						Absolute just came out to inspect my fireplace. I had some small cracks on the back wall I was worried about. They fixed the cracks for me with some epoxy and made it look like new! They also cleaned the chimney and gave it a clean bill of health. They showed up on time, were clean, and I loved their scheduling system that sent me text reminders of our appointment and when the tech was on their way. Really great company! I highly recommend!

						Easy to schedule and very clear upfront about scope of work and pricing. Called to see if they could come early. Very polite staff who clearly informed me of progress and results. Chimney only needed inspection so didn’t charge for cleaning. Dryer vent was way overdue and they did a great job. Finally everything was left clean and payment a breeze.
